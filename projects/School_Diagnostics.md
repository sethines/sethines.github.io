During the Summer of 2023, I was tasked with getting all technology ready for the upcoming fiscal 2023-2024 school year at an elementary school. This workload included normal procedures like making sure the Chromebooks were kept up to date with the testing standards and the WiFi was strong enough to support the extra students coming to the school. Along with those responsibilities, there were other mini-projects like ensuring that iREADY was working for both people who were using a QR code to sign in as well as passwords.

Since I am the only Technology Coordinator at the school, I was responsible for the entire workload. Over the course of a few weeks, all of the workload was systematically done. With the Chromebooks, all the organizational units needed to be updated to the most recent OS version through Google Administration. Once the OS was operational, each of the Chromebooks was set to their specific organizational units and tested to determine if the students would be able to take the test on them. Since the younger students would have a harder time typing in their passwords, I also needed to make sure that the Chromebooks sent to those classrooms were able to sign into iREADY using the QR code instead of the default username and password. 

Because of all the responsibilities that were given to me, I learned how to have good time management and to get things all done before the deadline of the first day of school. This project also challenged me since up until that point most of my dealing with computers was through Windows OS. I needed to adapt to how the Chrome OS reacts. Another learning experience through this project was learning how to effectively troubleshoot. When the network was not connecting to Chromebooks. I needed to start from the base which was determining if other Chromebooks could connect. When I determined this to be true, next was to start looking into the settings on the Chromebooks. Sometimes it was a faulty pass-through of the password and other times was because the Chromebook itself needed a power wash to eliminate the issue.
